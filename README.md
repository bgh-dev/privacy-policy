# PRIVACY POLICY

We deeply value your privacy and are committed to protecting it. We understand how important it is to you, and we want to be transparent about how we handle your information.


**WHAT WE COLLECT**

We are dedicated to providing a seamless and enjoyable experience without compromising your privacy. **We do not collect any personal data from you**. The only information we access is related to the use of ads in our app.


**ADVERTISING AND APP TRACTKING TRANSPARENCY (ATT)**

To support the development and maintenance of our app, we use third-party ad networks, including Google AdMob, to display ads. As part of this, we ask for your consent to track your activity for personalized advertising purposes through the App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework.


**YOUR CHOICES**

When you first use our app, you will be asked to grant permission for tracking. If you choose to allow tracking, this helps us serve ads that are more relevant to you. If you choose not to allow tracking, we will still show ads, but they may be less relevant.

For detailed information on how these ad networks handle your data, please review their privacy policies:

**OUR COMMITMENT**

We want you to feel secure and confident while using our app. Rest assured that we are committed to respecting your privacy and will never collect you personal information or misuse or sell your information. Your trust is our highest priority.

If you have any questions or concerns about our privacy practices, please feel free to contact us.
